<p>Ever wondered if there was a hassle-free way for your agency to capture important signatures?</p>

<p>Capturing signatures is vital to going completely paperless.  Our software can capture any signature from anyone needed during the patient care process.  We also have the ability to display HIPAA agreements as well as the disclaimers and refusal verbiage.  Crew signatures can be stored in the system for one-touch addition to any PCR.</p>

<p>Have you ever lost signal while filling out your PCR in a rural area or in a hospital?</p>

<p>AmbuSoft gives users the ability to use our software when they are not connected to the internet. Once your device fails to connect to signal, it will automatically go offline so that you can continue to fill out your PCR. Once the device connects to signal again it will automatically sync your PCR so that you do not lose any important patient data. </p>

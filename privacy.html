                                <h2>Section 1 - What do we do with your information?</h2>
                                How do you collect my information?

                                When purchasing something from us or use when you use our services for free, as part of the process, we collect the personal information you give us such as your name, address and email address.
                                When browsing our website, we also automatically receive your computer’s internet protocol (IP) address in order to provide us with information that helps us learn about your browser and operating system.
                                Email marketing: We may send you emails about our company, new products and other updates.

                                How do you use the information that you collect?

                                We may use the information we collect from you when you register, make a purchase, sign up for our newsletter, respond to a survey or marketing communication, surf the website, or use certain other site features in the following ways:

                                <h2>Section 2 - Consent</h2>
                                How do you get my consent?

                                When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, or return a purchase, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.
                                If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no.

                                How do I withdraw my consent?

                                If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at any time, by mailing us at: cloudpcr.sales@cloudpcr.net

                                <h2>Section 3 - Disclosure</h2>
                                We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information unless we provide you with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other    parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others’ rights, property, or safety.

                                However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses. We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of Service.



                                <h2>Section 4 - Third-Party Services</h2>
                                In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.

                                However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.

                                For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.
                                In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.
                                As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation.

                                Once you leave our website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.

                                When you click on the links on our website, they may direct you away from our site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites and encourage you to read their privacy statements.

                                <h2>Section 5 - Security</h2>
                                To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and follow industry best practices to make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed altered or destroyed.
                                If you provide us with your credit card information the information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology(SSL).

                                <h2>Section 6 - Cookies</h2>
                                Cookies are files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your browser (if you allow) that enables the site’s or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.

                                How do we use your cookies?

                                To help remember and process items
                                Understand and save user’s preferences for future visits
                                Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions in order to offer better site experiences and tools in the future.
                                We may also use trusted third-party services that track the information on our behalf.

                                If you disable cookies in your internet browser, some features will be disabled.

                                <h2>Section 7 - Age of Consent</h2>

                                <h2>Section 8 - Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                                We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently. Changes and clarifications will take effect immediately upon their posting on the website. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here that it has been updated, so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we use and/or disclose it.
                                If our website is acquired or merged with another company, your information may be transferred to the new owners so that we may continue to sell products and services to you.

                                <h2>Section 9 - Other Agreements</h2>
                                We do not specifically market to children under 13.

                                We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
                                We collect your email address in order to be in accordance with the CAN SPAM we agree to the following:

                                If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at
                                and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.
                                Users can visit our site anonymously. Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.

                    <p>"I love charting", said no one ... ever ... seriously, never. We have never talked to an EMS professional that joined the EMS industry for all the great paperwork opportunities - but that is where a lot of time is spent. Our team hates unneeded paperwork too. We make charting less painful through our intuitive UI, and more powerful through our streamlined features.</p>
                    <p>We pride ourselves on being a team of multifaceted developers, engineers and EMS professionals. We care about the quality of our software and how it improves the experience of its users.</p>
